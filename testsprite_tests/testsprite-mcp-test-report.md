## 🔍 Detailed Test Analysis

### ✅ **Strengths Identified**
1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - All major features have dedicated test cases
2. **Realistic Scenarios** - Tests use practical business use cases
3. **Performance Validation** - Response time and data volume limits tested
4. **Error Handling** - Edge cases and invalid inputs covered
5. **API Structure** - Proper validation of response formats and data types

### ⚠️ **Issues Encountered**
1. **Connection Problems** - Proxy/tunnel issues prevented test execution
2. **API Mismatch** - Tests expect REST API endpoints, but Streamlit uses different architecture
3. **Authentication** - Tests assume direct API access vs. web UI interaction

### 🛠️ **Recommended Fixes**

#### **For Immediate Testing:**
1. **Manual Testing** - Use the generated test cases as manual test scripts
2. **Unit Tests** - Convert test logic to pytest for individual functions
3. **Streamlit Testing** - Use Streamlit's testing framework for UI components

#### **For Production Readiness:**
1. **API Endpoints** - Consider adding REST API layer for programmatic access
2. **Error Handling** - Enhance error messages and validation feedback
3. **Performance Monitoring** - Add logging for response times and data processing
